# Click Counter

A web application is a click counter that displays a real-time world map indicating the distribution of clicks. It uses IP geolocation to determine the country of each click and updates the map. The map's color scale changes based on the number of clicks per country. 

This project was made as a submission in the Lighthall Software Engineering Super League Level 1.
